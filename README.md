# EDA-Students-Performance
EDA [Exploratory Data Analysis] of Student's Performance

### Objectives-
To understand the how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by the other variables :
  <ul style="list-style-type:square";>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Ethnicity</li> 
    <li>Parental level of education</li>
    <li>Lunch</li> 
    <li>Test preparation course</li>
</ul>

### What to do in Exploratory Data :
* To Analyse insights in the dataset.
* To understand the connection between the variables and to uncover the underlying structure
* To extract the important Variables.
* To test the underlying assumptions.
* Provide Insights with Suitable Graphs and Visualizations.

I have used matplotlib and seaborn libraries of python for data visualization of dataset.
